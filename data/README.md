Background

Carvana is a start-up business that is being launch by a well-established American company. Its goal is to completely change the way people buy, finance, and trade their used vehicles by replacing physical infrastructure with technology and top of the line scientific models. It is an ambitious project that will require building new analytics and systems for which there are no precedent.
